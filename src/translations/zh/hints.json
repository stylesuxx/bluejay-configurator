  "STARTUP_BEEP": "Enable beep melody when the ESC is powered up.",
  "BRAKE_ON_STOP": "Brake when motors are stopped.",
  "BEACON_DELAY": "After how much time of inactivity the beacon should start to go off.",
  "TEMPERATURE_PROTECTION": "At which temperature the ESC will shut down.",
  "BEEP_STRENGTH": "The volume of the startup beeps. Setting this too high might damage the motors.",
  "BEACON_STRENGTH": "The volume of the beacon. Setting this too high might damage the motors.",
  "STARTUP_POWER_MIN": "The least amount of power applied when starting up the motors. Increase if motors are not able to start up with low throttle input.",
  "DITHERING": "Increases the effective pwm resolution 2000 steps. It is generally recommended to leave this on especially with pwm frequencies above 24kHz.",
  "STARTUP_POWER_MAX": "Limits power when starting motors or reversing direction.",
  "RPM_POWER_SLOPE": "Limits how much power can be increased according to how fast the motor is spinning. Lower values will avoid power spikes but can also decrease acceleration and maximum attainable speed.",
  "MOTOR_DIRECTION": "The motor rotation direction can be normal or reversed. In bidirectional mode, center throttle is zero.",
  "COMMUTATION_TIMING": "Motor commutation advance timing. Higher timing are less prone to desyncs and can provide more power at the cost of efficiency.",
  "DEMAG_COMPENSATION": "The extent to which power should be cut to protect against motor stalls caused by long winding demagnetization time after commutation."
